My Journey: Cybersecurity Internship - Task 1 (Scanning My Local Network)
Hello and Welcome!
Process:
Install Nmap. 
Find your local IP range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24). 
Perform a TCP SYN scan using nmap -sS [your IP range]. 
Note down found IP addresses and open ports. 
Optionally, analyze packet capture with Wireshark. 
Research common services running on those ports. 
Identify potential security risks from open ports. 
Save scan results as a text or HTML file. 
Outcome: The task aims us to know basic network reconnaissance skills and an understanding of network service exposure.
